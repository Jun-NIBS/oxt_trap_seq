## RNA-seq of Oxt Neurons

The [`Oxt_trap_seq` GitHub repository](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/oxt_trap_seq/edit/master/README.md) contains code and summarized data for RNA sequencing of Oxt neurons in the mouse. 

Raw gene counts, as a [RangedSummarizedExperiment object](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html) can be downloaded from [here](rseObjs_oxtMerge_n18_4features.Rdata)

Code for various analyses described in the paper can be found below:

- [Comparing Bdnf hets to wild type samples](analyze_data_bdnf.R)
